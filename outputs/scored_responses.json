    "question": "What is the function of the NVIC in the STM32F4 microcontroller?",
    "model_answer": "A: The NVIC (Non-Volatile Interrupt Controller) is a hardware component of the STM32F4 microcontroller. It is responsible for managing interrupts and handling them in a non-volatile manner.\nThe NVIC is divided into two main sections: the Global Interrupt Vector Table (GIVT) and the Global Interrupt Priority Register (GIPR).\nThe GIVT is a table of interrupt vectors that are mapped to specific interrupt sources. Each interrupt source can have multiple interrupt vectors assigned to it.\nThe GIPR is a register that controls the priority of interrupts. It allows the user to set the priority of each interrupt source, from lowest priority",
